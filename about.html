                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <img src="images/IMG_2551.jpg" alt="my picture">
                <p>I’m a driven and curious sophomore at the University of Southern Mississippi, pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering. While my journey into the tech world began only recently, I’ve been diving in headfirst—exploring, learning, and building the skills that will shape my career.</p>

                    <p>My fascination with technology isn’t limited to what’s taught in the classroom. I spend a significant amount of my time taking online courses to push my knowledge further. From web development to data science and machine learning, I enjoy exploring the full spectrum of what’s possible in the digital space. Every project, tutorial, and late-night coding session adds another piece to the bigger picture I’m working toward.</p>

                    <p>On the technical side, I’ve built a solid foundation in several programming languages, including Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These skills have opened the door to creating interactive websites, experimenting with algorithms, and even exploring the early stages of machine learning models. I see programming as both a logical challenge and a creative outlet—where solving problems is just as satisfying as creating something entirely new.</p>

                   <P>Although I haven’t landed my first internship yet, I’m actively preparing for that next step. I believe in consistent self-improvement, whether that’s learning a new framework, practicing coding challenges, or refining my ability to work in teams. For me, this stage of my career is about building a strong skill set, nurturing a problem-solving mindset, and laying the groundwork for bigger opportunities ahead.</P>

                    <p>Ultimately, my goal is to grow into a versatile engineer capable of contributing to meaningful, impactful projects—whether in software, hardware, or the exciting space where the two intersect. I’m not just here to keep up with the fast-moving tech industry; I’m here to be part of shaping it.</p>
